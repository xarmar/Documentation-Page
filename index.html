                    <p>Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.

                        JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.
                        
                        In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
                        </p>
                    <p>For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.</li>
                            <li>React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.</li>
                            <li>Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).</li>
                            <li>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.</li>
                            <li>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>In technical terms, Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated 
                        dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. It is extremely attractive in the field of 
                        Rapid Application Development because it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options. </p>
                    <p>What can Python do?</p>
                        <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>

                    <p>It is a free-to-use programming language that’s also open source. In any case, it’s a widely used language, that’s designed for use in the distributed environment of the internet.</p>
                    <p>It’s a popular tool, and for a variety of reasons. From the inherent benefits, to the after-effects. I’d 
                        like to take you through some of its merits. Firstly, this language is simple for even novel developers. 
                        Java is quick to learn, making this a highly logical choice.</p>
                    <p>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
                            <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
                            <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
                            <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
                            <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h2>Kotlin</h2> 
                </header>
                    <p>Kotlin is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. It is widely used 
                        to develop Android application. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of 
                        its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more 
                        concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM but also compiles to JavaScript or native code. Kotlin is sponsored 
                        by JetBrains and Google, through the Kotlin Foundation.</p>
                    <p> <strong><u>Features of Kotlin</u></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Concise</strong>: Kotlin is more concise than Java and you would need to write approximately 40% fewer lines of code when compared to Java.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Kotlin programming language is highly interoperable with Java. You will never face any difficulty using Kotlin in a Java project.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature-rich</strong>: Kotlin provides several advanced features such as Operator overloading, Lambda expressions, String templates, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Easy</strong>: Kotlin is easy to learn programming language. If you have come from a Java background, you would find it easy to learn Kotlin.</li>
                        <li><strong>Less error-prone</strong>: As I have mentioned before, Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language, which makes you able to catch errors at compile-time, as Statically typed programming languages do type checking at compile-time.</li>

                    <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building 
                        user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers 
                        and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. 
                        However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating 
                        React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain 
                        client-side functionality.</p>
